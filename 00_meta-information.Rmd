# Meta information

There should be here the libraries, dataset, odk and sampling frame and any other thing.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
main_dataset <- read.csv("inputs/UKR2007_MSNA20_HH_dataset_main_rcop.csv", na.strings = "")
loop_dataset <- read.csv("inputs/UKR2007_MSNA20_HH_dataset_loop_rcop.csv", na.strings = "")
```
Note that some variables were NA (age, etc.) In addition, it seems the weights are alredy added, and both loops where combined already.


Probably which packages are used and version
