# Meta information

There should be here the dataset, odk and sampling frame and any other thing.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
main_dataset <- readxl::read_excel("inputs/UKR2007_MSNA20_HH_dataset_rcop.xlsx",
                                   sheet = "dataset")
loop_dataset <- readxl::read_excel("inputs/UKR2007_MSNA20_HH_dataset_rcop.xlsx",
                                   sheet = "combained_member_of_hh_profile")
```
Note that some variables were NA (age, etc.) In addition, it seems the weights are alredy added, and both loops where combined already.

Probably which packages are used and version
