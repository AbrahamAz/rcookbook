# Meta information

There should be here the dataset, odk and sampling frame and any other thing.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
main_dataset <- read.csv("inputs/UKR2007_MSNA20_HH_dataset_main_rcop.csv")
loop_dataset <- read.csv("inputs/UKR2007_MSNA20_HH_dataset_loop_rcop.csv")
```
Note that some variables were NA (age, etc.) In addition, it seems the weights are alredy added, and both loops where combined already.

Probably which packages are used and version
